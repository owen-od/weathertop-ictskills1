# WeatherTop
## About the project
It is a web application, which functions as a companion application for a modular weather station called the WeatherTop 1000. 

The web app has simple start, register and login pages/views when the app is first opened. When members log in they are presented with a dashboard where they can view the latest weather readings for all the stations associated with their account.
Each location is displayed on a map (using Leaflet).  Members can also add and delete stations. Members may open any particular station to get a view of all the weather readings for the station. Members can also add and delete readings manually, 
or auto generate a reading from OpenWeather API. There is a simple about page presenting some information about the app and the team. Finally members may make use of the account page to edit their details. 

## Built with
